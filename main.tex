\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap:intro}
Start off all chapters with \verb|chapter|. \verb|\extrachapter| will give you an unnumbered chapter that's added to the Table of Contents. Labeling is also good practice. That way you can reference sections and chapters from anywhere. For instance, I can reference Sec.~\ref{sec:exsection} from here.

Here's an example of a citation \citep{GMP81}. Here's another \citep{PP98}. These will appear in the big bibliography at the end of the thesis.

If you're new to \LaTeX{} and would like to begin by learning the basics, please see our free online course available at:\\ \url{https://www.overleaf.com/latex/learn/free-online-introduction-to-latex-part-1} \index{LaTeX@\LaTeX}

You can define terms and/or symbols in a glossary \index{glossary} as you talk about key terms in your thesis. So what's a \gls{galaxy}? These can also include acronyms, such as \acrlong{leo}, which is abbreviated as \acrshort{leo}. You should always define acronyms at the point of first use in the text, in addition to including them in the glossary.

\begin{minted}{julia}
# function to calculate the volume of a sphere
function sphere_vol(r)
    return 4/3*pi*r^3
end
\end{minted}


\section{This is a Section} \label{sec:exsection}
\lipsum[1-2]

Check this out! I can reference a figure number in the text of the document by referring to Fig.~\ref{fig:logo}.

\begin{figure}[hbt!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{cwru_logo.eps}
    \caption{This is a figure. \label{fig:logo}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{This is a Subsection} \label{subsec:exsubsec}

\begin{table}[hbt!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
Area & Count\\
\hline
North & 100\\
South & 200\\
East & 80\\
West & 140\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{This is a table. \label{tab:sample}}
\end{table}

\lipsum[3] 

I can add another glossary entry wherever I like, and I can make it capitalized by using the macro command with a capital letter like this: \Gls{asteroid}. The quadratic formula is given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:quadratic}.
\begin{equation}
    x=\frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}
    \label{eq:quadratic}
\end{equation}

\lipsum[4-5] 

\section{This is Another Section}
\lipsum[6-7] 

\chapter{This is the Second Chapter}
\lipsum[8-9]


\chapter{This is the Third Chapter}
See? I can reference the first chapter from all the way down here. I think the first chapter was Chapter~\ref{chap:intro}.
\chapter{This is the Fourth Chapter}
\chapter{This is the Fifth Chapter}
\chapter{This is the Sixth Chapter}
\chapter{This is the Seventh Chapter}
\chapter{This is the Eighth Chapter}
